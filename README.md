#### Alexa, play “SexyBack.” I’ve finished my PhD.

In short: the human species has an unfortunate habit of reproducing. Enthusiastically. The planet, meanwhile, has a rather more finite approach to resources—food, in particular, being a touchy subject when everyone insists on eating daily.

Now, forcibly limiting the population à la Thanos or Eren Yeager is considered poor form at dinner parties. So, instead, we need more food. Enter: the cricket.

Crickets are protein-rich, low-maintenance, and, crucially, unlikely to unionise. Excellent candidates for scalable nutrition. But there’s a catch:

For companies to keep making crickets, they must profit from crickets. And to profit from crickets, they must produce crickets efficiently. This is complicated by the fact that crickets are small, numerous, and tragically uncooperative. Selfish, really.

Thus: Research. With a capital R and a slightly manic glint in the eye.



**Chapter 1: Make crickets researchable** | 
(Make a system where the tiny idiots an be studied without a magnifying glass and a breakdown.)

**Chapter 2: Maximise yield** | 
The goal is simple: more crickets, bigger crickets, fewer dead crickets. The method? Pack them in like commuters on the Jubilee line and figure out what makes them start dying en masse.

**Chapter 3: Launch them into space** | 
Eventually, someone’s going to try to eat breakfast on Mars,and raymeon packets take up alot of space (I would know). 

**Chapter 4: Make it all look good** | 
Tell the story. With art. Because people don’t read white papers, but they will stare at a pretty picture and say “Oh wow, that’s deep,”.

Now, while I await my Nobel Prize, I'm off to law school.
